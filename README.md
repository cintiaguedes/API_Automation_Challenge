## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-behave-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-behave-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Tests

Execute the following command to run the Behave tests:

```bash
behave
```

## Configuration

The project uses a `behave.ini` file for configuration. Modify this file to customize Behave settings.

Example `behave.ini`:

```ini
[behave]
format = progress
```

## Test Reports

If you want to generate test reports, you can use a specific formatter like Allure.

Install Allure:

```bash
pip install allure-behave
```

Run Behave with Allure formatting:

```bash
behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o ./allure-results
```

To view the report, use the Allure command-line tool or a compatible viewer.
